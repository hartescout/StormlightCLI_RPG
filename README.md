## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ Choose Your Order
Begin your journey by swearing the Ideals. Choose between legendary Orders, each with unique abilities:
- **Windrunners**: Protectors who command the surges of **Adhesion** and **Gravitation**. Fly through the air and Lash your enemies.
- **Lightweavers**: Artists and spies who command **Illumination** and **Transformation**. Distract foes with illusions and soulcast your way to victory.

### 🏃 Bridge Runs & Narrative Events
Face the brutal reality of a bridgeman. Every run to the Shattered Plains is different:
- **Arrow Volleys**: Use your Surges to deflect incoming fire or hide behind your shield.
- **Chasm Jumps**: Leap across impossible gaps using Stormlight-enhanced athleticism.
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Will you save a wounded comrade or conserve your Light for the coming battle?

### ⚔️ Combat & Surgebinding
Engage in tactical combat against Parshendi and other threats. Manage your **Stormlight** carefully—it is both your lifeblood and your greatest weapon. Use it to heal your wounds or unleash devastating Surges.

### 🌬️ Survival & Highstorms
The Stormfather's wrath is no joke. Seek shelter during Highstorms or risk everything to gather infused spheres.

### 🧚 Spren & Lore
Interact with your spren for advice, lore, and guidance. Every Radiant needs a companion on their path to greatness.
